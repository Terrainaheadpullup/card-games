standard-deviation-effect.py
I have realised that if you decrease the probability of an event happening but inversely proportionally increase the number of trials so that the average of the number of
successes will remain the same, the standard deviation between all the numbers of successes will increase Logarithmically. This code will output the standard deviations
for all integer values of x were the probability of the event succeeding is 1 in x.
